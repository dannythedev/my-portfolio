        <h3>Race Against the Clock</h3>
        <p>Confront the toughest levels and their daunting obstacles: <b>lightning strikes</b> that can trigger mine detonations and <b>blizzards</b> that can freeze your board! Your task is to tactically delay the bar that sets off these weather effects as it nears depletion. Each successful move grants a slight reprieve, urging you to maintain a swift pace. While flagging a cell offers a measure of safety, time is fleeting, leaving no space for indecision!</p>

      <h2>Calculating Cell screen positions of \(N\) Cells in \(O(1)\) Runtime instead of \(O(N)\).</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>This function determines if the player's mouse cursor is currently positioned over a cell. If it is, then it updates the current coordinates as the current cell's indices.</p>
      <div class="section">
      <h3>Mathematical Evaluation</h3>
        <strong>Naive Approach:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\) due to iterating over all grid cells to check for collisions with the mouse cursor.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Optimized Approach:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilizes a bounding box check to quickly determine if the mouse cursor is within the grid area.</li>
          <li>Computes the mouse cell location directly using simple arithmetic operations. In this case, Let:</li>
          <ul>
            <li> \( S_x^{\text{max}} \), \( S_y^{\text{max}} \): Dimensions of the screen in pixels. </li>
            <li> \( M_x \), \( M_y \): Current mouse position on the game's screen in pixels. </li>
            <li> \( w \), \( h \): Number of cells in each row and column. </li>
            <li> \( C \): Size of each cell in pixels. </li>
            <li> \( S \): Constant spacing between adjacent cells, adjusted based on the scale of the cells in pixels. </li>
            <li> \( D \): Total dimension of each cell, defined as \( C + S \). </li>
            <li> \( G_x^{\text{min}} \), \( G_y^{\text{min}} \): Starting x and y-coordinates of the grid in pixels, computed as \( \left\lfloor \frac{{S_x^{\text{max}} - (w \times D) }}{{2}} \right\rfloor\) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{{S_y^{\text{max}} - (h \times D) }}{{2}} \right\rfloor\) respectively. </li>
            <li> \( G_x^{\text{max}} \), \( G_y^{\text{max}} \): Ending x and y-coordinates of the grid in pixels, computed as \( G_{x}^{\text{min}} + w \times D \) and \( G_{y}^{\text{min}} + h \times D \) respectively. </li>
            <li> \( \text{col} \), \( \text{row} \): Row and column indices of the cell that the mouse is hovering over, measured in cell indices. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>So that, if \( G_x \leq M_x < G_x^{\text{max}} \) and \( G_y \leq M_y < G_y^{\text{max}} \) are within bounds, then:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>\( \text{col} = \left\lfloor \frac{{M_x - G_x}}{{D}} \right\rfloor \)</li>
            <li>\( \text{row} = \left\lfloor \frac{{M_y - G_y}}{{D}} \right\rfloor \)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Time Complexity: \(O(1)\), as the computation time remains constant regardless of grid size.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Calculating Mouse Precision Movement \((CPM)\).</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>This mechanic is responsible for tracking and evaluating the performance of the mouse movements made by the player during gameplay.</p>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Mathematical Evaluation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Let \( (x_{\text{prev}}, y_{\text{prev}}) \) be the mouse position in the previous cell reveal, and \( (x_{\text{curr}}, y_{\text{curr}}) \) be the mouse position in the current cell reveal.</li>
          <li>Let \( d_{\text{mouse}} \) be the total distance traveled by the mouse between cell reveals.</li>
          <li>Let \( d_{\text{min}} \) be the minimum distance between the current and previous mouse positions. \( d_{\text{min}} = \sqrt{(x_{\text{curr}} - x_{\text{prev}})^2 + (y_{\text{curr}} - y_{\text{prev}})^2} \)</li>
          <li>The current accuracy is calculated as a percentage of \( d_{\text{min}} \) relative to the total distance traveled: \( \text{current_accuracy} = \frac{d_{\text{min}}}{d_{\text{mouse}}} \times 100 \).</li>
          <li>Accumulate the sum of all accuracies for every set of two consecutive clicks, and divide them by their amount, showing the mean of all accuracies in real-time.</li>

      <h2>Calculating Clicks Per Second \((CPS)\)</h2>
    
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>This mechanic tracks and evaluates the user's pace by measuring the rate at which cells are successfully revealed per second during gameplay.</p>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Mathematical Evaluation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Let \( T \) be the total time elapsed during gameplay, measured in seconds.</li>
          <li>Let \( C \) be the total number of cells successfully revealed during the time period \( T \).</li>
          <li>The Clicks Per Second (\( CPS \)) is calculated as the ratio of the total number of cells revealed (\( C \)) to the total time elapsed (\( T \)): \[ CPS = \frac{C}{T} \]</li>
